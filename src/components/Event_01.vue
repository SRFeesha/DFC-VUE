    <h1>Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</h1>
    <p>
      It’s an exciting time to be a designer. Everything is growing! Teams, products, users. We’re in a
      never-ending marathon to grow and operate at scale. At Spotify we’ve been growing at a rapid pace for
      over a decade, creating a service that reaches hundreds of millions of fans around the world.
      Growth presents all kinds of challenges that have little to do with the craft of UX design. How do
      we come up with great ideas and get them noticed amidst the sea of other great ideas? How do we get
      our whole organization as passionate about our users as we are? How do we collaborate across squads
      in our agile environment to create a user experience that doesn’t show the seams?
      Service design is an essential tool for our team to tackle these problems. And as a team leader, I see
      even bigger results from doing the work of service design as part of our process. These activities make
      our designers stronger so they’re able to make faster, better decisions in the moments that matter. I’ll
      share how we’ve successfully brought service design into our practice, and how it’s changing the way we
      work with others.
